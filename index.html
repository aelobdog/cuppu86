         Cuppu86 is an 8086 emulator written in C89.
         <br>
         <br>
         Work in progress !
         <br>
         <br>
         for now, a few opcodes have been implemented. I expect to complete
         the project(atleast the backend) by the end of May, 2021. There is
         also a plan to write a GUI frontend for the cuppu86, but since I'm
         not well versed in the dark arts of GUI programming, I suspect it'll
         take a bit longer to implement that.
