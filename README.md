# Cuppu

## What is Cuppu ?
Cuppu86 is an 8086 emulator written in C89.

## Goals
I'm a third year student currently and as part of my coursework, I have taken a course on microprocessors. I am using this opportunity to understand how microprocessors work, for example how instructions are fetched, decoded and executed, etc.

Since the main goal of the Cuppu86 project is to understand how the processors like the 8086 work, there is little to no importance given to make the codebase clean/elegant/whatever.
